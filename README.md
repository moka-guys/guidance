# Software development guidance

These are guidance documents that cover coding style, versioning, and documentation of code written in the bioinformatics groups of the London South Genomic Laboratory Hub (Guy's and St.Thomas', King's College Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield).

All bioinformaticians should follow these guidelines. Any change should be appropriately communicated to contributors.

*NB* This repository does not require tagged versions and ignores the standard branching model (single master branch only). Please use pull requests for submission of substantial changes.
