# SEGLH Operational and Development Guidance

South East Genomics Laboratory Hub software development guidance.

## Purpose
This guidance aims to set common standards and values in development and deployment of bioinformatics applications and 
workflows accross the South East Genomics Laboratory Hub. It also sets out to unify software development lifecycles and 
tooling to enhance interoperability and sets out a framework to allow collaborative development of software.

These guidance documents cover coding style, versioning, and do
cumentation of code written in the bioinformatics groups 
of the London South Genomic Laboratory Hub (Guy's and St.Thomas', King's College Hospital, Royal Brompton and 
Harefield). Further they issue recommendations and requirements that ensure the safety, reliability and error 
prevention during the software lifecycle.

This repository also includes the Google documentation and style guides which are recommended reading.

## Adoption
All bioinformaticians _should_ follow this guideline, implement its policies and record adoption there of in their 
organisations QMS, referencing version number (and commit identifier). Any change should be appropriately communicated 
to contributors.

*NB* This repository does not require tagged versions and ignores the standard branching model (single master branch 
only). Please use pull requests for submission of substantial changes.


## Continuous development
This guidance _should_ be continuously developed by all current and future adopters. Suggested changes should be 
reviewed and integrated acccording to the principles outlined in this guideline. 

Changes can be suggested at any time and will be immediately integrated after review by at least one member of each 
participating organisation.

The review considers that the proposed change _shall_ be:

1. Not in contradiction to a current policy or guideline that has been adopted by other laboratoes of the SEGLH.
2. Does not reduce interoperability capabilities of current processes.
3. Aiming to increase safety by reducing complexity or manual processes.
4. No impede or invalidate current established processes, unless those have been marked for retirement or replacement.
5. Not preventing the adoption of the guidance due to local incompatibilities.

This new version _can_ be adopted immediately. This allows individual laboratories or organisations to adapt quickly 
while wider adoption 

## Review and Revision
The guidance _shall_ be reviewed on an annual basis by the SEGLH Bioinformatics committee. The review should include 
the following:

1. Review of introduced changes.
2. Approval of new guidance.
3. Issue of new version number.
4. Report 

Any new versioned issue of this guidance _should_ be approved and adopted within 6 months.
