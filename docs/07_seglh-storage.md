# Data storage and archiving
This section applies to the storage of NGS or other diagnostic dervied data. For datastorage related to regular backups of production infrastructure, refer to local requirements and regulations.

## Requirements
All data storage _must_ comply with current regulations or recommendations issued by either the Royal College of Pathologists or the ACGS.

## Service resiliency and recovery
All data that is not inherently backed up via cloud based redundancy is subject to a continuous backup requirement and recovery plan. 

## Archiving
Separate archiving policy (WIP).
